## Qualification Tournaments

There will be 3 virtual Super-Regional Qualification Tournaments in May, one for each region:

- Americas
- African + Europe
- Asia + Pacific

After the registration, teams will be assigned to their Super-Regional automatically.
Each Super-Regional will play 7 rounds of [Swiss System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament).
After those rounds, the best team from each country will automatically qualify
for the Tournament in June.

Of the remaining teams, the best teams in each Super-Regional (top-of-the-table)
will also qualify, "per wildcard".
Those wildcards will be given independently of country to the best teams.
The number of wildcards will be proportional to the size of the Super-Regional, meaning
the largest Super-Regional will receive the most wildcards (but 2/3rd of all wildcards at most).

**Note:** This may result in some countries sending more teams than other countries.
On the other hand, each country will be able to send at least 1 team.
Since this is the first year of RCJ Soccer Sim, and since there is no way to approximate the
number of teams per country before the registration deadline, a fixed-sized quota
does not work.


**Note:** This qualification process is for RCJ Soccer Simulation Challenge only!
It does not apply to *RCJ Soccer Lightweight League* or *RCJ Soccer Open League*!
Please follow the official channels for qualification information on
*Lightweight League* and *Open League*.
