The simulator is based on [Webots](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots).
The associated [repository](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/rcj-soccer-sim)
provides both the "automatic referee" (which implements the
[Soccer Simulated Rules](rules.md))
as well as a sample team of robots with some basic simulated strategy.
