# Code submission

To play the competition, the code that's powering the team's robots needs to
get to the organizers.

Let's talk a bit about how to do this.

## From controllers to a submission

Suppose you have the folder structure which looks like this

```
controllers/
├── robot/
│   └── robot.py
│   └── robot1.py
│   └── robot2.py
│   └── robot3.py
|   └── utils.py
```

To submit it for the competition, there are two (well, maybe three) things we
need to do:
1. Add a team name
2. (Optionally) add a team logo
3. Create a ZIP archive

### Add a team name

The folder structure above does contain some code but it is not immediately
obvious which team does it belong to.

To make it obvious, please create a file called `team_name.txt` on the same
level as `robot/`. This file should contain a single
line of text: the name of the team (up to 32 characters).

The resulting folder structure would then look as follows:

```
controllers/
├── robot/
│   └── robot.py
│   └── robot1.py
│   └── robot2.py
│   └── robot3.py
|   └── utils.py
└── team_name.txt
```

### (Optionally) add a team logo

**Note:** _This step is completely optional and you can just skip it -- your
robot controllers will still work, even if you do not provide a custom logo for
your team_.

If you'd like, you can optionally also add a custom logo for your team's
robot. It will be used as an overlay on the robots in the simulator.

The logo needs to be stored in the [PNG format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics)
and located in a file called `logo.png`.

If you choose to add one, the folder structure will look something like the
following:

```
controllers/
├── robot/
│   └── robot.py
│   └── robot1.py
│   └── robot2.py
│   └── robot3.py
|   └── utils.py
├── logo.png
└── team_name.txt
```

### Create a ZIP archive

This step is very simple: you just pick **the directory** that contains
the code for your three robots, the `team_name.txt` file and optionally `logo.png` and put them all
together into a single `.ZIP` file. There are many utilities that will do the
job -- we can recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

When you look into the resulting `.ZIP` file, the folder structure should look
as follows:

```
.
├── robot/
│   └── robot.py
│   └── robot1.py
│   └── robot2.py
│   └── robot3.py
|   └── utils.py
├── logo.png
└── team_name.txt
```

Note that there is no `controllers/` folder anymore -- the `.ZIP` file only
contains a single `robot/` folder and a single text file called `team_name.txt`
(and optionally the `logo.png` image).

## Uploading your submission

Once you have your `.ZIP` file ready, the only thing left is to submit it to
the organizers. In practice, this generally means uploading it to a specific
location that will be shared with all the participating teams well before the
submission deadline.

Feel free to test whether your ZIP file conforms to the required structure at
our [Check of the ZIP Submission](submission_check.md) page.

## Things to keep in mind

- The resulting `.ZIP` file can be at most 10MB in size.

- The `.ZIP` file you submit needs to have **exactly one** first-level
  folder. That is, the folder structure after unzipping cannot look as
  follows:

```
.
├── robot1
│   └── robot1.py
├── robot2
│   └── robot2.py
```

  The tournament organization software would not know which three robots to
  pick up and would most likely end up picking them up randomly.

- The organizers will run a code similarity detector on the submitted code.
    Yes, wheels really do not need to be reinvented but it would really not be
    fair to win a competition with something that's not primarily the team's
    own work. Submissions with significant overlap of duplicated code will not
    be permitted to compete in the competition.

- The code you submit will be open sourced at the end of the competition.

- If you managed to find a bug, have any question or ran into some problem,
    please do not hesitate to ask [on the forum](https://junior.forum.robocup.org/c/robocupjunior-soccer/5).
